We start by importing the data

```{r}
raw.df <- read.csv('processed_personality_quiz_responses.csv')
colnames(raw.df) <- c('X', 'X', 'q1', 'q2','q3','q4','q5','q6','q7)
data.df <- 

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
